	<h2>Description</h2>
	<div class="content-desc">This game was developed for a 5-day Game Jam organized by <b>U-Tad</b> that had "Spanish gastronomy" as its theme. </div>
	<div class="content-desc">We developed a frenetic party game, set in a bullring, that involved making paellas with ingredients thrown by the audience. The player would have to catch the correct ingredients  mid-air(rice, chicken, beans, and lemons), while ignoring other objects and food thrown, in order to cook as many paellas as possible within the time limit. Once the time was up, a bull would appear and it would start chasing the player. The player could still play and try to complete paellas, but once the bull catches them, the game would end.</div>
	<h2>Role in the project</h2>
	<div class="content-desc">We developed the game as a team of five people. We brainstormed together to define and design the game, and then we made a list of tasks to be completed and divided them up among us. As part of the team, I developed various game systems, which I later shared with the rest of the team so everyone could know how everything worked.</div>
	<div class="content-desc">Since all 5 members of our team were programmers, most of the 3D models & art used in the game came from free asset packs.</div>
