	<h2>Description</h2>
	<div class="content-desc">I based my Master's Thesis of the <b>Master's Degree in Computer Graphics, Virtual Reality and Simulation</b> on the study of the main challenges that arise when developing a video game for virtual reality, especially when adapting games to the technology that were not originally designed for it, and to try to find solutions. To achieve this, I adapted two classic arcade games whose features, at first glance, did not seem compatible with virtual reality: Pong and Snake.</div>
	<div class="content-desc">The main idea under the development was to create virtual reality adaptations of these games that remained faithful to the original concepts while also meeting the standards and requirements of the technology, creating a good sense of immersion and presence for the user.<div>
	<div class="content-desc">In the Pong adaptation, I added a 3rd dimension to the game and placed the player in one of the goals, with the "paddle" being a semi-transparent energy barrier that the player could open and close at will, so as not to obstruct the view of the game. I created a retro-futuristic setting to contextualize the game, and the necessary interfaces -such as the scoreboard- were implemented diegetically in the setting to create and maintain immersion. New features were also added to the base game, such as the ability to have stadiums of different sizes and obstacles, or the ability to perform charged shots that give the ball greater speed.<div>
	<div class="content-desc">For Snake, I decided to solve the perspective-change problem by having the player being a gnome and riding the snake, controlling it with reins. A colorful and animated cartoon setting was used to help the player accept unlikely situations without breaking the immersion. The snake's body is defined by splines and dynamic meshes, allowing for a controlled and gradual growth of the body as it eats apples.<div>
	<div class="content-desc">Finally, I also created a scene based on an arcade as a common diegetic menu between both games, as a way of providing a narrative that would allow game selection and travelling between scenes without breaking immersion.<div>
	<h2>Role in the project</h2>
	<div class="content-desc">I conducted an extensive study and analysis of the games to be adapted, and carried out their complete development and implementation, detailing the entire process in a report document that also provided a contextual framework on the technology and the problem to be addressed, and the reached conclusions.</div>
