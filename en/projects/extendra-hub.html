	<h2>Description</h2>
	<div class="content-desc">Extendra Hub is a virtual reality solution designed to meet the collaboration needs of companies and workers. The platform enables users working on team projects to cowork, organize meetings, and conduct virtual conferences, facilitating efficient communication and collaboration. </div>
	<div class="content-desc">It is a cross-platform multiplayer application that allows up to 30 simultaneous users on the same map, available for VR -published in the Meta Quest store- and PC.</div>
	<div class="content-desc">The application had multiple maps adapted to group work equipped with useful tools: whiteboards, notes, screensharing from a PC to a virtual screen, passthrough windows to the real world, the possibility of loading custom media via the web backend... And offering both formal and casual environments.</div>
	<h2>Role in the project</h2>
	<div class="content-desc">I was part of a team made up of other Unreal Engine programmers, several artists in charge of designing and modeling the environments, and a web programmer that developed the application's web backend.</div>
	<div class="content-desc">I collaborated with the other programmers to implement the various desired technologies and interactions. As a way to organize the work of the team, we used the agile Kanban methodology, with a board where we listed tasks in priority order and updated their status in daily meetings.</div>
	<div class="content-desc">Among the most important features I was in charge of in this project were the implementation of hand-tracking as an alternative to using controllers to interact with the application, the adaptation of some interactions so that they could also be performed from a PC, the creation of a tool that opened a passthrough window, and the connection to the backend via websockets.</div>
