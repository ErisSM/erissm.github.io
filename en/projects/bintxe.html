	<h2>Description</h2>
	<div class="content-desc">I was offered this job shortly after my contract with Extendra ended. The idea of ​​the project was to create a website that could serve as a gallery for the work of an illustrator and comic artist. Although web programming isn't my specialty, having recently worked both on my personal blog and this portfolio, and given the fact that the proposed website was static and not overly complex, I decided to accept it.</div>
	<div class="content-desc">The developed website contains an illustration gallery that uses a <i>true masonry</i> layout, a section with the presentation of his current comic project and an introduction to his characters, and two comic readers for different comic formats: page-based comics and <i>webtoon</i> (vertical comics that use the browser's scroll) to view the client's projects.</div>
	<div class="content-desc">The website is responsive, ensuring correct viewing on different screen resolutions. Cookies are also used to save the visitors' preferred language and their reading progress through the comics on the page.</div>
	<h2>Role in the project</h2>
	<div class="content-desc">As this was a job I took on individually, I was responsible for the development of the entire project. I worked closely with the client, trying to execute his vision as faithfully as possible, providing frequent project updates and making changes and modifications as he requested.</div>
	<div class="content-desc">I prototyped all the interfaces and pages of the website and, after they were approved, I was responsible for programming them and providing them with functionality. I also performed numerous tests to ensure proper operation in a variety of scenarios and ensure a good user experience.</div>
