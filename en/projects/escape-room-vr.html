	<h2>Description</h2>
	<div class="content-desc">This was developed as a final project for a subject in the <b>Master's Degree in Computer Graphics, Virtual Reality and Simulation</b> in which we were asked to create a virtual reality game akin to a 'escape room', with challenges and puzzles to complete in order to progress in the game.</div>
	<div class="content-desc">I again used the OpenXR API for the basic virtual reality framework. As for the game itself, I designed a science fiction escape room with five rooms, each with its own puzzle to solve. Completing each of the challenges in these rooms would reward you with a floppy disk, which were the keys needed to complete the game.</div>
	<div class="content-desc">Among the mini-games to solve there were: finding a secret code hidden among interactive objects, a bow shooting challenge, a puzzle with moving platforms controlled by levers, and a level with a jetpack that allowed you to ascend vertically using limited boosts.</div>
	<div class="content-desc">In addition to programming the various challenges and interactions, I also developed shaders to create visual effects in some areas and I implemented some optimization techniques, such as disabling inactive rooms until the player approached the door to access it.</div>
	<h2>Role in the project</h2>
	<div class="content-desc">I was the sole developer of the project, as it was an individual submission for the university.</div>
