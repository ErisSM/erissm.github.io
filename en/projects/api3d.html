	<h2>Description</h2>
	<div class="content-desc">This was a project developed over an entire subject of the <b>Master's Degree in Computer Graphics, Virtual Reality and Simulation</b>, while also being the evaluation test for said subject.</div>
	<div class="content-desc"> The objective of the development was to create a graphics engine that would allow the creation and visualization of 3D scenes using the OpenGL 4 graphics library. The engine's features included the creation of 3D objects consisting of one or more polygon meshes -with support for materials, vertex colors, textures, and normal maps-, point or directional lights, perspective & orthogonal cameras, particle emitters, and skeletons for animated models. All of this was programmed in a C++ class system that initialized and made the necessary calls to the graphics library to render the scene objects. Vertex and fragment shaders were also developed in GLSL to perform color and lighting calculations.</div>
	<div class="content-desc">As the final task for the project, the Vulkan graphics library was also implemented into the engine, but only allowing the rendering of unlit meshes.</div>
	<h2>Role in the project</h2>
	<div class="content-desc">I was the sole developer of the project, as it was an individual submission for the university.</div>
