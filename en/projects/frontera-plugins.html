	<h2>Description</h2>
	<div class="content-desc">At La Frontera/Extendra, we maintained a repository of our own Unreal Engine plugins with features that could be reused by future projects.</div>
	<div class="content-desc">After a project was finished, or by studying propossals for future projects, we made a collective effort at the company to identify those features that might be useful and likely to be used by future developments, and they were prioritized to be implemented in plugins.</div>
	<div class="content-desc">The plugins were developed with the core idea that they would be independent from each other, separated according to the need they responded to, having plugins for VR interactions, multiplayer, voice chat, multimedia, making HTTP requests... So when a new project begins its development, only those plugins with functionalities required by it would be imported.</div>
	<h2>Role in the project</h2>
	<div class="content-desc">Maintaining and expanding the company's plugins was the responsibility of the entire programming team. As an essential requirement, the plugins' code had to be clean & commented, and any new contributions had to maintain cohesion with the rest of the classes and avoid unnecessary dependencies. </div>
	<div class="content-desc">As a programmer, I worked extensively with the company's plugins and made numerous contributions to them, particularly to those related to VR and AR functionalities and the creation of a hand-tracking plugin.</div>
