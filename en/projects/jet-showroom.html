	<h2>Description</h2>
	<div class="content-desc">This project consisted in the development of a custom Virtual Reality application for a private aviation company to provide guided tours of their aircraft to interested clients.</div>
	<div class="content-desc">The app was developed for Meta Quest 2 and featured five aircraft that could be explored both on the outside and the inside. It featured numerous interactive elements, such as the ability to open doors and cabinets or recline seats. The app could also be used both with the system's own controls or via hand-tracking, allowing for more natural interactions with the environment. </div>
	<div class="content-desc">One of the main requirements for the app was to allow group visits, guided by company staff. To achieve this, a multiplayer mode with voice chat was implemented, allowing up to eight people plus the guide to join a multiplayer room.</div>
	<div class="content-desc">In addition, it also allowed for the recording of replays and statistics from these sessions, sending everything to a web backend where they could be consulted later.</div>
	<h2>Role in the project</h2>
	<div class="content-desc">I participated in the project from its inception to its completion as the sole Unreal Engine programmer. The team also included various artists who created 3D modeling of the aircraft and environments, and a web programmer who was in charge of developing the application's backend.</div>
	<div class="content-desc">My responsibilities in the project consisted of implementing the client's desired features for the VR application, from multiplayer and net replication to creating interactions. Some of these features hadn't been implemented in any previous project of the company, such as the use of hand-tracking and natural interactions, or the saving of session replays, so I had to research and develop these features from scratch.</div>
	<div class="content-desc">The development of all these functionalities was done primarily in <b>C++</b> code, with a small portion in Unreal Engine <i>Blueprints</i> for the simpler features.</div>
