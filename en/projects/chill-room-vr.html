	<h2>Description</h2>
	<div class="content-desc">This was developed during my <b>Master's Degree in Computer Graphics, Virtual Reality, and Simulation</b>,and it was one of the first projects I made for Virtual Reality. The goal of this project was to create an immersive space with a relaxing theme and a handful of context-appropriate VR interactions.</div>
	<div class="content-desc">I decided to design a cozy house on a winter day, using primarily free 3D assets and creating my own shaders with Shadergraph to create various effects, such as a fire for the fireplace and falling snow, among others.</div>
	<div class="content-desc">For VR integration, I used the OpenXR API and used it to create interactions and activities to do in the app: you can turn on the TV, change channels, and turn the volume up and down; make coffee in a coffee maker, play a game of darts, or go outside and make a snowman with objects you can find scattered around the place.</div>
	<h2>Role in the project</h2>
	<div class="content-desc">I was the sole developer of the project, as it was an individual submission for the university.</div>
