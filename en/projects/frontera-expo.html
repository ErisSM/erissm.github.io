	<h2>Description</h2>
	<div class="content-desc">EXPO consisted in a multiplayer VR application for internal use by the company, designed for demonstrations at fairs or to clients as a showcase of our work at La Frontera. </div>
	<div class="content-desc">The app contained a selection of varied maps, each responding to potential use cases that other companies might find in virtual reality: meeting spaces, virtual showrooms, immersive 3D videos, training and education...</div>
	<div class="content-desc"></div>
	<h2>Role in the project</h2>
	<div class="content-desc">I worked in the final phase of the project as an Unreal Engine programmer, collaborating with other programmers and artists. I was responsible for implementing interactions for two of the maps that were to be included in the app: a replica of an apartment, in which the materials of multiple surfaces (walls, furniture, countertops, fabrics, etc.) could be changed with a tool; and a museum, where each artwork had a hotspot point that could be touched to expand a panel with information about it.	</div>
